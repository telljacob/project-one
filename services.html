                <p><strong>Brand Campaigns</strong></p>
                <p>I will help your idea of how to represent your brand exactly how you would like it and make the campaign reflect the emotion you want to your audience. 
                    Together we plan the outfits and decide on location beforehand. I put together a mood board of how I imagine our idea. The brand provides the designer 
                    and with your approval I will put together the team of a model, a hair- and makeup stylist. From there we set the day and shoot! Afterwards I will send my first bigger selection from where 
                    you choose the images you want to be edited. Voila!</p>
